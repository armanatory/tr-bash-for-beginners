# commands




```bash
# this print the current directory
pwd

# pushd with popd works better than the cd command
pushd <NAME OF THE DIRECTORY>
# then by the command popd it returns to the previous dir
popd

# wildcard: search for all files ending with .md
ls *.md
# the question mark match with e.g. one unknown character
ls *.?d
# returs all upper case characters 
ls [[:upper:]]*


```
